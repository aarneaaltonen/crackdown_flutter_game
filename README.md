# Crackdown

*Crackdown* is a Easter themed score-chaser game made with Flutter. Your objective is to drag eggs to corresponding baskets before they crack and break


The application is hosted at https://crackdown-game.web.app/

# How to Play

 **Drag the eggs into the matching colored baskets.**

 **Be careful!** If an egg hits a wall, it will crack.

* Four cracks, and the egg breaks.

If an egg breaks or is sorted into the wrong basket, the **GAME** is **OVER**.

Earn points by correctly sorting eggs.

**Watch out!** As time goes on, the eggs will come faster — stay sharp and act quickly!

Good luck and have fun!
